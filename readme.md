# Web Development Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome! 🫡
This repository marks the beginning of my journey into **Web Development**. Here, I'll be posting my progress, code snippets, projects, and resources as I learn the core technologies and skills needed to build awesome websites and web applications.

## About Me🥱

I'm ASHRIT a CS Engineering student at ITM Univ. Gwalior.... just starting out with web development and excited to learn the basics—from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and beyond technologies such as advanced frontend and also backend. I love to document my learning path, share what I build, and hopefully help others who are also new to web development.

## What You'll Find Here🥱

- **Learning Notes:** Summaries and notes from tutorials and courses.
- **Code Samples:** Practice exercises, mini-projects, and experiments.
- **Project Ideas:** Small projects to apply new concepts.
- **Useful Resources:** Links to helpful articles, documentation, and tools.

## Technologies I'm Learning

- **HTML** – Structure of web pages
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – Interactivity and logic
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration
- **later i will deep dive into other technologies too...😉😉**
